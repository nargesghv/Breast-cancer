# Breast-cancer
working on the breast cancer Data.Model the Data with random forest and descision tree classifier
modeling data with random forest make confiousion matrix as below

![Confusion matrix](/download0.1.png?raw=true "descision tree")

the confusion matrix for random forrest

![Confusion matrix](/random.png?raw=true "descision tree")

compare two matrix and comming up with random forrest better result
# Define the grid for the number of trees on random forrest
comming up with {n_estimator's=200}
# retrieve the relative importance of each variable and visualize the importance plot
Feature importances using permutation on full model for decreasing of mean accuracy
# get the feature importances from the fitted model using MDI
for decreasing on impurity
